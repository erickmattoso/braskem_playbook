# GOAL

## Find the relevant data that helps you answer the questions that define the objectives of the project.

Identify data sources that contain known examples of answers to your sharp questions. Look for the following data:

- Data that's relevant to the question. Do you have measures of the target and features that are related to the target?
- Data that's an accurate measure of your model target and the features of interest.

For example, you might find that the existing systems need to collect and log additional kinds of data to address the problem and achieve the project goals. In this situation, you might want to look for external data sources or update your systems to collect new data.
