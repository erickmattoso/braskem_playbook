As Data Scientist
I want to create the best ML|AI Solution
In order to do that i will make sure to create a good documentation about my ML|AI approaches design bellow.

Depending on the type of question that you're trying to answer, there are many modeling algorithms available. For guidance on choosing the algorithms, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/algorithm-choice. 


Checkpoint decision: 
Evaluate whether the model performs sufficiently for production. 
Some key questions to ask are:
How my data is real generate, what are the relations in the world?
Can we split the data randomly?
Are we working with timeseries data? Do we need a rolling forecast?
What are the optimal data features for the machine-learning model?
Does the model answer the question with sufficient confidence given the test data?
Does the model achieves a satisfactory performance in the choosen metric?
What are the best hyperparameters for the model? Should we do a Grid Search?
How can we build the baseline model? Cross-Check with the project needs.
Should you try any alternative approaches?
Should you collect additional data, do more feature engineering, or experiment with other algorithms?
PCA Analysis, does our model improve?
Does our a machine-learning model is suitable for production?
