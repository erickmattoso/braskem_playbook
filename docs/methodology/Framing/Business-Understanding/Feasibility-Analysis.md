# GOALS

### Specify the key variables that are to serve as the model targets and whose related metrics are used determine the success of the project.
### Identify the relevant data sources that the business has access to or needs to obtain.

## Data Accessibility

Is the data available - points to be considered below:

- What we have to do in order to have it available for the model online deployment? 
- How much will it cost? 
- How long will it take for us to have the data available?
- Can it be a roadblock for the deployment?

## Data Consistency

What is the profile of the data that we have available?

- How does it behavior? 
- Does it present any outliers? 
- Is it influenced by external factors that are not [yet] measured? 
- Can the behavior/outliers/external factors potentially be roadblocks for our initiative?

## Data Completeness

- Is the data workable? 
- Does it require much wrangling?
- Do we have enough data points enough to create a model with a reasonable confidence level (considering too, accuracy)?

## Data Frequency

- Are there any infrastructure barriers or developments that need to be address now?
- Do we need to engineer a new pipeline?
- What tools and resources can we explore to extract data (e.g. DarivaÂ´s solutions, ChemTech, Central PIMS, AT team)
- Does the event I am trying to capture occur at a frequency that can be captured by the available sensors? 
- Is the data online?
- If necessary, can I change the data collection frequency so I can capture the event? 
- Do I store this data in my databases, or where do I store the data?
