As a Machine Learning Engineer
I want to define if i need to retrain the ML|AI model
In Order to deliver the best solution to the costumer need, we need to measure the model performance.


What are the requirements from business stakeholders?
Does the nature of the project has change?
Does the project has a new database?
Does the ranges of my model operation need to be refined?
Does our model start to Drift? Do we have triggers to identify when the model start to Drift
Do we have a development environment apart from the production?
We need More|Updated data to retrain the ML|AI?
