The Machine Learning Engineer should deploy models with a data pipeline to a production or production-like environment for final user acceptance.
After you have a set of models that perform well, you can operationalize them for other applications to consume. Depending on the business requirements, predictions are made either in real time or on a batch basis. To deploy models, you expose them with an open API interface. The interface enables the model to be easily consumed from various applications, such as:
Online websites
Spreadsheets
Dashboards
Line-of-business applications
Back-end applications
