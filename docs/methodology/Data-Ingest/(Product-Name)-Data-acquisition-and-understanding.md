We as Data Engineer and Data Scientist
Want to Produce a clean, high-quality data set ready to model.
In order to do that  we will create the environment  so the the data set is in the appropriate locate so analytics can be done.

Here the infraestructure would be well defined. Here we will create the tables.
The Bronze table is the first look at the data set.
Import the data
The Silver Table is where you go to exploration.
Here you will start understanding the patterns of the data, here you can test abould the predictive model you will try.
Should be very clear that the data it's good to go to the modeling stage.
The Gold Table is where you 
You get the Bronze table e start to work on. One good approach to a good data exploration is IDEAR, Iteractive Data Exploration, Analysis and Reporting.
Find evidences (correlation) between the data and the business target.
