# Quality Control

1. Data Centric – ML solution that uses existing process data to predict product quality, allowing us to operate more efficiently and reduce the time it takes to get product quality results from 4 hours to 15 minutes..

1. Potencial gains R$3MM a.a.

1. Product Quality reduced from 4hrs to 15 minutes, improvement of 94% in efficiency.

1. Raman - Build machine learning algorithm that uses spectral data ("lasers") to measure the composition of the material in real time.
